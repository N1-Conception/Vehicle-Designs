# 🚗 Embedded Vehicle Designs Portfolio



Welcome to my collection of embedded vehicle designs created using SolidWorks. This repository serves as a showcase of my skills in mechanical design, 3D modeling, and embedded systems integration.




## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is part of my personal portfolio, aiming to:

- Demonstrate proficiency in SolidWorks for complex vehicle design.

- Highlight projects that integrate mechanical components with embedded systems.

- Provide a visual and technical reference for potential collaborators or employers.




## 🛠️ Projects Overview

Each project folder contains:

- **3D Models**: Detailed SolidWorks parts and assemblies.

- **Technical Drawings**: Engineering drawings for manufacturing.

- **Embedded Systems**: Integration of sensors, actuators, and control units.

- **Documentation**: Project reports and design rationales.

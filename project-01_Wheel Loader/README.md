# ðŸšœ Wheel Loader Motion | SolidWorks Project

Welcome to the *Wheel Loader Motion* project  â€” a high-detail 3D model brought to life through motion animation in *SolidWorks*.



## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

This project is a continuation of my previous static SolidWorks model of a *realistic wheel loader*, now enhanced with basic motion elements including:

- âœ… *Bucket Lift & Tilt Animation*

- âœ… *Tyre Rotation*

- ðŸ›  Built using *mates* and *motion constraints* to replicate real-world mechanical movement

> âš™ This is part of a mechanical design series focused on modeling and animating construction machines using CAD.
